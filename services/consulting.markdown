We gained our knowledge and developed methodology of formulating a mess from the experience in the trenches. We offer our expertise and help in terms of consulting services related to public policy design, strategy formulation and implementation of ill-defined and complicated projects involving many stakeholders and interests, as well as plain stakeholders' analysis and project management. Our consulting services are specifically designed for helping organizations and institutions which need to make sense of and coordinate a large number of different interests in a diverse and changing social, economic or business environment.
