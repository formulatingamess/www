I went through the website, made a few comments on the pdf. I also read the contents and I have a few additional general
remarks:

1. "formulating a mess" is a very good teaser for presentations because its humor but a bad motto because it is does not sound serious and authoritative. It communicates the idea that the mess is here to stay just being formulated... not a prospect many will appreciate or will be willing to pay for...  I like much the "science and art" angle. Everybody knows that complex problems require methods which are not entirely "procedural" and it is better than the "mess" angle.

vveitas: I do not agree with this - formulating a mess is in my opinion good for both consulting and presenting. Saying 'procedural' will need another sentence of two to explain what it is. 'A mess' is something everybody knows from the first mention.

2. The English is not good enough. Quite a few mistakes and the overall level of linguistic expression though using the right content is far from professional. I recommend the text will receive proofreading and editing before approaching prospective clients.

vveitas: This is postponed until we have the final version and also feedback from prospective partners.

3. Some of the content need a better description without sacrificing simplicity. For example: "everybody is right"  or "there is no objective truth" seem to me way too simplistic slogans and are IMO not professional. How about: "in complex situations, no one is entirely wrong and no one is entirely right - what matters is a collaborative construction of a shared perspective", and "There is no single version of the truth but rather multiple perspectives of reality that need to be cohered" etc...

We can further discuss it when am bit less busy...
