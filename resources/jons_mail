From a conceptual point of view, I only have one comment: when we look at the HOW it feels very one-sided, i.e. the consultant that takes the data and gives you his/her opinion. I was wondering if we add in your process a ‘facilitating the process of moving from present to future’ just after the ‘conceptual modelling stage’. Even as a third main theme, e.g. data collection, data analysis and collective design

(you know the content and steps of the process, so disregard my comment if it is irrelevant)

vveitas: Done - included another group of bullet points about facilitating the process;

I will add the EC Senior Entrepreneurship Project, the Development of  National Quality Strategy in the Philippines and some of the standardization projects (as by definition off the standards process it requires the involvement of all relevant stakeholders)

vveitas: waiting for that;
