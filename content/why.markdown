Today's accelerating networked world is getting increasingly dynamic and difficult to predict. New technologies, new professions, new opportunities, new challenges -- *new unknowns* -- seem to fall on us before we are able to figure out how to make sense of the current ones. Traditional strategic planning and management approaches are failing. The sensible strategic planning horizon has shrinked from years to months and is still decreasing, rendering it both ineffective and inefficient. The plans become obsolete in no time. The traditional cycle of strategic and project management -- *plan* \\(\rightarrow\\) *execute* \\(\rightarrow\\) *analyze* \\(\rightarrow\\) *correct* \\(\rightarrow\\) *plan* needs make a full cycle at breakneck speed in order to work. Actually, uncertainty, unpredictability and complexity become the major characteristics of our social, economic and business governance.

There are three interrelated reasons for the increasing complexity: hyperconnectivity, reflexivity and accelerating change. <explain all three in few sentences>.
