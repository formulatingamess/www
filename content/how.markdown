As is often a case, the science of formulating a mess is rather a toolbox than a single recipe. The art of it lies in finding the right combination of tools and techniques for applying its <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/content/what">conceptual approach</a>. Therefore the concrete answer to the question "how to do it?" is best answered with case studies and examples. This is precisely why we organize <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}#infosessions">info-sessions</a> where specific cases will be addressed based on face-to-face communication.

Nevertheless, here some of the tools and tricks which have their place in the toolbox:

* **Purposive sampling** which amounts to: 

	* First, identification of *interest groups*, which currently or potentially have their say in the policy or strategic direction to be designed;
	
	* Second, selecting representative members of every interest group for interviewing and further work;

* Data collection techniques, including:
	
	* **Secondary data collection** - extracting relevant information from available historical reports, memos and technical papers;
	
	* **Primary data collection** - in depth interviews with representatives of interest groups;

* Data analysis techniques:
	
	* **Qualitative data analysis** (QDA) - text coding and thematic annotation using computer aided QDA tools;
	
	* State-or-the-art **conceptual modelling** techniques, resulting in verbal and visual models of the current, future desired situations of the policy area or project and a system of policy/strategic interventions required to bridge the gap between the two;

* **Anonymity**. Importantly, we never disclose identities of representatives of interest groups which are being interviewed. Anonymity policy has proved to be very important when working with, e.g. business competitors.
