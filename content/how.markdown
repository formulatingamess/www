As is often the case, the science of formulating a mess is rather a **toolbox** than a single recipe. The art of it lies in **finding the right combination of tools and techniques** for applying the <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/content/what">conceptual approach</a>. Therefore the concrete question "how to do it?" should be addressed in a context of case studies and examples. This is precisely why we are organize info sessions where specific cases are addressed in a hands-on manner.

Here are some of the tools and tricks which have their place in the toolbox:

* **Purposive sampling** which amounts to: 

	* First, identification of interest groups, which currently or potentially have their say in the policy or strategic direction being designed;
	
	* Second, selecting representative members of every interest group for interviewing and further work;

* **Data collection** techniques, including:
	
	* Secondary data collection - extracting relevant information from available historical reports, memos and technical papers;
	
	* Primary data collection - in-depth interviews with representatives of interest groups;

* Data analysis techniques:
	
	* **Qualitative data analysis** (QDA) - text coding and thematic annotation using computer aided QDA tools;
	
	* State-or-the-art **conceptual modelling** techniques, resulting in verbal and visual models of the current, future desired situations of the policy area or project and a system of policy interventions required to bridge the gap between present and future;

* **Process facilitation** techniques for moving from present to the future;

	* Setting up an **action research** cycle for facilitating an iterative process of multi-stakeholder management;

	* Periodic **focus groups** for updating information and scrutinizing models of current and future situations. 

* **Anonymity**. Importantly, we never disclose identities of representatives of interest groups which are being interviewed. Anonymity policy has proved to be very important when working in, e.g. business environment.
