First and foremost, the art and science of formulating a mess signifies a change in perspective, a philosophy, a lens of looking to the world. It can be best characterized by the following statements:

* **The world is not *my* playground - it is *our* playground**. This means that if we want to play, we have to come *together* and figure out why, what and how do we want to play and agree on the rules. Time have passed when there was one boy who was dictating a game.

* **There is no *objective* truth**. Even if there is one, it does not matter any more. In other words, what is considered true or not is constructed by ourselves in a collaborative process. Nobody can engage into this process alone. It may be difficult to accept for religious absolutists, but take it from the following perspective: even though there may be the God, who knows the truth, nobody can approach him directly. Therefore, we are left arguing over all kinds of rules and sacred texts left for us. And *that is a social collaborative process*.

* Therefore, he world (and the truth) **is socially constructed** in two related senses, as distributed cognition and as shared realities[^1]. In other words, we define our playground and rules of the game. But (see above), nobody can do it alone.

* **Everybody is right** (in his/her own way). Only the one who thinks that only she/he is right is wrong. What this comes to mean is that even when we see conflicting opinions, positions and approaches, we have to approach them as if all of them are equally legitimate and rational *given the circumstances* of an a person holding this position.

* **Understanding** does not mean being able to predict, or construct a working model of the reality - it means being able to *see the world through the eyes of others*.

* Most of the problems can be solved by questioning **common sense**. Common sense is like a habit - and in most cases, it is a bad one. The only way to see beyond your habit is to meet the ones which do not have it (and consider them seriously).

The art of formulating a mess amounts to an application of these principles in constructing 'shared realities'. The science of it refers to tricks and techniques of actually doing it - see <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/content/how">how to systematically manage stakeholders</a>.
